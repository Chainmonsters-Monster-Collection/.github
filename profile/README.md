## 🎮 What is Chainmonsters?

Chainmonsters is a cross-platform online RPG where players capture, train, and fuse digital monsters known as Chainmons. Set in the world of Ancora, the game blends turn-based combat and classic creature collection with full blockchain ownership. Each Chainmon and cosmetic is a unique NFT, tradable on-chain.
